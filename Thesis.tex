I, Theo DE FRAMOND, declare that this thesis titled, `Functional testing and qualification of the Serval Mesh Extender' and the work presented in it are my own. I confirm that:

\begin{itemize} 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] This work was done wholly or mainly while in candidature for a research degree at this University.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where any part of this thesis has previously been submitted for a degree or any other qualification at this University or any other institution, this has been clearly stated.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have consulted the published work of others, this is always clearly attributed.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] Where I have quoted from the work of others, the source is always given. With the exception of such quotations, this thesis is entirely my own work.
 
\item[\tiny{$\blacksquare$}] I have acknowledged all main sources of help.

This paper is the thesis of my Master Project COMP9710A in Flinders University, School of Computer Sciences as an exchange student from France. It explains all the work, tasks and experiments I have done during my project. The remainder of this content concerns the perspectives and the motivations of such a project and also what I have retained about it.\\
My project takes place in the humanitarian and open source project called Serval. Serval Project purpose is to providing means of communication to people in the incapacity of having cellular coverage. To this end they have developed a smart-phone application and a special smart antenna called the Mesh Extender. My role here is to write automated tests to make sure these Mesh Extender are ready for their next use.

I would like to thank the all telecommunication laboratory of Flinders in Tonsley for their participation in the project and for having supported my work and helped me get results of better quality. I am particularly grateful to my supervisor Paul Gardner-Stephen for his patience and support in overcoming numerous obstacles I have been facing through my research. Thanks him for having accepted me in his team.

I would like to thank my fellow students and the ISS of Flinders University for their feedback, cooperation and kind welcome. 

Nevertheless, I am also grateful to my French school INSA Lyon for having given me the opportunity to get here and work in this wonderful country which is Australia. Thanks Isabelle Auge-Blum and the DRI for having organized my student exchange and thanks the jury for having changed their decision regarding this exchange which was at first forbidden for me. 

I would like to thank my friends for accepting nothing less than excellence from me. Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents and to my sister for supporting me spiritually throughout writing this thesis and my life in general.

\ldots
