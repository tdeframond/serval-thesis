This paper is the thesis of my Master Project COMP9710A in Flinders University, School of Computer Sciences as an exchange student from France. It explains all the work, tasks and experiments I have done during my project which is the Serval Project and how I did it. The remainder of this content concerns the perspectives and the motivations of such a project and also what I have retained about it\ldots

I would like to thank the all telecommunication laboratory of Flinders in Tonsley for their participation in the project and for having supported my work and helped me get results of better quality. I am particularly grateful to my supervisor Paul Gardner-Stephen for his patience and support in overcoming numerous obstacles I have been facing through my research. Thanks him for having accepted me in his team.

I would like to thank my fellow students and the ISS of Flinders University for their feedback, cooperation and kind welcome. 

Nevertheless, I am also grateful to my French school INSA Lyon for having given me the opportunity to get here and work in this wonderful country which is Australia. Thanks Isabelle Auge-Blum and the DRI for having organized my student exchange and thanks the jury for having changed their decision regarding this exchange which was at first forbidden for me. 

I would like to thank my friends for accepting nothing less than excellence from me. Last but not the least, I would like to thank my family: my parents and to my sister for supporting me spiritually throughout writing this thesis and my life in general.

\ldots
