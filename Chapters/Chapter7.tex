\chapter{Conclusion and future directions}

My master project is now completed and I can say that it was a really good experience for me. Some of the tests are finished and uploaded, we can now check automatically various features of the new Mesh Extenders to bring them to Vanuatu. We can automatically check the firmware of a device and update it with the last version. Admittedly some of the tests are not working because of numerous issues I met during the project like the "update issue", but they are still here and part of my work. Thanks to them, I have learned so much about the world of research and about how do I have to organize my work as being part of it.

However this is just the beginning of the work. My project is finished but THE project has just started. More tests have to be done. More Mesh Extender have to be checked and send to Vanuatu. More people have the right to use distant communications. This become now the work and the project of the following French students who will come here for the next semesters. I will give them my work so they have something to start with and I have faith in what they will accomplish as I have faith in the Serval Project which is a really was a really good adventure for me. I sincerely hope that this adventure is just about to become bigger and bigger.
