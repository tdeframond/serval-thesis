\chapter{Introduction}

This chapter of my thesis is the "why?" of my project. I am explaining here what are my motivations that leaded me to this and why i wanted to chose this work as my end study project instead of an other one. The scope and the context of this experiment are also part of this chapter. The two last points i am discussing here concern all my research questions and the global structure of my thesis.

\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Australia}
Of course and since I live in France, an important motivation was to travel and discover Australia. But as this "touristic" motivation is not very appropriate in this thesis I will not develop it that much. But I still want to say that traveling is essential for a human to grow and get mature. This apply for becoming a engineer as well. Now that the semester is almost finished, I can tell that this abroad experiment has helped me to get prepared for my future life by making me think in a different way and more.\\

\subsection{Telecommunication}
Second motivation is the field of telecommunications. This is my studies and what I am interested in. It was thus obvious that this project will fit to me. Indeed, the Serval Project concerns an emergency phone network. It deals thus with antennas, communication protocols and signal processes. All this topics will be helpful for my future jobs. All what I learned in the past years in my school, I can apply it here on this project which is totally on the continuous of my studies track. 

\subsection{Laboratory and Research}
In my five years of study, I have never really worked in a laboratory as a researcher. I have done many tutorials and practical works with my class but it was just study and nothing to see with research. I wanted thus to discover the world of research and how all of this work. How is running a laboratory ? Who is in charge of it ? What are the relationships in it ? How are the projects financed ? I am really happy now to know much more about this part of the engineer world. 

\subsection{Humanitarian}
Last and not the least, I really appreciate the humanitarian aspect of the project. Indeed, as I will explain in the next section, the Serval Project is here to help poor islands from the pacific to recover after a natural disaster for example. It can also be the first step for poor villages to have access to distant communication without having to invest into expensive and permanent infrastructures. If I can work for a good and human purpose, it is better. I am really happy to help in this adventure rather to work for big industries who just care about money despite the environment or human conditions.
